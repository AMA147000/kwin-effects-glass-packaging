This repo's whole purpose is to be used for packaging [kwin-effects-glass](https://github.com/4v3ngR/kwin-effects-glass) on [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ama1470/kwin-effects-glass).

Note:
- I am not the developer/maintainer of the kwin-effects-glass project, I am just packaging it for convenience. 
- This is ***not*** a nightly build, meaning it only updates on releases.
